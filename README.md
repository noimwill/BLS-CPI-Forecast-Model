# BLS-CPI-Forecast-Model
This is a model I developed to forecast the official BLS YoY CPI reading using Truflation's YoY CPI data. I first developed and used this model in excel but decided to rewrite it using Python for others to integrate into any projects they are working on, or tweak it to attempt to produce better results. The accuracy of the model has been +/- 0.3%.
